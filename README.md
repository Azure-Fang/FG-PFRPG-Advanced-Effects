Original extension by [Celestian](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/forums/member.php?54726-celestian). Ported to PFRPG/3.5E by [rmilmine](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/forums/member.php?215591-rmilmine) and [bmos](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/forums/member.php?194283-bmos).

Attach effects to PCs, NPCs and items.

# Compatibility
This extension has been tested with [FantasyGrounds Unity](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/home/FantasyGroundsUnity.php) 4.1.13 (2022-01-05).

# How does it work?
When you apply the extension to a 5E campaign you'll notice a new field on items, npcs and character sheets (under Abilities tab) called "Effect Features".

For items, when you add an effect such as "IFT: ALIGN (evil); AC: 2;" it will be placed on the owner of the item if they equipped the item and are in the combat tracker.

You will also notice the same type of entry for NPCs. It works similar to the above except when you drag/drop the NPC into the combat tracker these effects will be added automatically.

You will also notice the same type of entry for Player characters, under the "Abilities" tab in a section called "Advanced Effects". It works similar to the above except when you drag/drop the PC into the combat tracker these effects will be added automatically.

Here are the places you'll notice differences:

There is one Campaign Setting. This allows the PC with an item that has an advanced effect to see and edit it if enabled. It's disabled by default.

The action "Action Only" effect (only used when THAT weapon/item is used for attack/damage).
